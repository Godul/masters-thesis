    "## The goal\n",
    "The **goal** of our experiments is to determine the coefficient $a_{t_i t_j}$ of impact of type ${t_i}$ on type ${t_j}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We run the experiment and we calculate the coefficient. Then we run it again, and we get a slightly different result. We can proceed with that procedure and think of it as sampling a **distribution** of coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Is this distribution normal?\n",
    "This distribution is not necessarily normal, but we suspect it to be normal, because we use average latency/throughput from some time intervals to calculate our coefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, this can be checked with large enough sample: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normality_test\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to determine one coefficient from a list samples?\n",
    "This is an important conceptual question. We want a coefficient that reflects the impact of two types best.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the possible aproaches is to simply take the **average coefficient**:\n",
    "* The average coefficient is the good for most number of cases - in total, we gain the most.\n",
    "* We already use average values to calculate the coefficient in every experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "### How many samples are necessary?\n",
    "We want to be as accurate as possible, but each experiment takes much time to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we use average coefficient, then we can use interval estimation to calculate the confidence interval with some confidence level, using following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ P\\left({\\overline {X}}-u_{\\alpha }{\\frac {\\sigma }{\\sqrt {n}}}<m<{\\overline {X}}+u_{\\alpha }{\\frac {\\sigma }{\\sqrt {n}}}\\right)=1-\\alpha $\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "* $n$ – sample size,\n",
    "* $\\overline {X}$ – average of the sample,\n",
    "* $\\sigma$  – standard deviation of the sample,\n",
    "* $u_{\\alpha }$ – a statistic satysfying $P(-u_{\\alpha }<U<u_{\\alpha })=1-\\alpha$, where $U$ is of $N(0,1)$\n",
